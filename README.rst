pyMCR: Multivariate Curve Resolution in Python
===============================================================

pyMCR is a small package for performing multivariate curve resolution.
Currently, it implements a simple alternating least squares method
(i.e., MCR-ALS).

MCR-ALS, in general, is a constrained implementation of alternating
least squares (ALS) nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Historically,
other names were used for MCR as well:

-   Self modeling mixture analysis (SMMA)
-   Self modeling curve resolution (SMCR)

Available methods:

-   Regressors:

    -   `Ordinary least squares <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lstsq.html>`_ (default)
    -   `Non-negatively constrained least squares 
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.nnls.html>`_
    -   Native support for `scikit-learn linear model regressors 
        <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html>`_
        (e.g., `LinearRegression <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares>`_, 
        `RidgeRegression <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ridge-regression>`_, 
        `Lasso <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#lasso>`_)

-   Constraints

    -   Non-negativity
    -   Normalization
    -   Zero end-points
    -   Zero end-points of cumulative summation
    -   Non-negativity of cumulative summation
    -   Compress or cut values above or below a threshold value
    -   Replace sum-across-features samples (e.g., 0 concentration) with prescribed target
    -   Enforce a plane ("planarize"). E.g., a concenctration image is a plane.

-   Error metrics / Loss function

    -   Mean-squared error

-   Other options

    -   Fix known targets (C and/or ST, and let others vary)

What it **does** do:

-   Approximate the concentration and spectral matrices via minimization routines. 
    This is the core the MCR-ALS methods.
-   Enable the application of certain constraints in a user-defined order.

What it **does not** do:

-   Estimate the number of components in the sample. This is a bonus feature in 
    some more-advanced MCR-ALS packages.

Installation
------------

Using pip (hard install)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    # Only Python 3.* installed
    pip install pyMCR

    # If you have both Python 2.* and 3.* you may need
    pip3 install pyMCR

Using pip (soft install [can update with git])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::
    
    # Make new directory for pyMCR and enter it
    # Clone from github
    git clone https://github.com/CCampJr/pyMCR

    # Only Python 3.* installed
    pip install -e .

    # If you have both Python 2.* and 3.* you may need instead
    pip3 install -e .

    # To update in the future
    git pull

Using setuptools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to `download the repository <https://github.com/CCampJr/pyMCR>`_
or clone the repository with git:

.. code::
    
    # Make new directory for pyMCR and enter it
    # Clone from github
    git clone https://github.com/CCampJr/pyMCR

Perform the install:

.. code::

    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from pymcr.mcr import McrAls
    mcrals = McrAls()
    
    # MCR assumes a system of the form: D = CS^T
    #
    # Data that you will provide (hyperspectral context):
    # D [n_pixels, n_frequencies]  # Hyperspectral image unraveled in space (2D)
    #
    # initial_spectra [n_components, n_frequencies]  ## S^T in the literature
    # OR
    # initial_conc [n_pixels, n_components]   ## C in the literature

    # If you have an initial estimate of the spectra
    mcrals.fit(D, ST=initial_spectra)

    # Otherwise, if you have an initial estimate of the concentrations
    mcrals.fit(D, C=initial_conc)
